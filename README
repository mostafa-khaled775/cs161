This repository has C code implementing (almost?) all of the algorithms
lectured about in the Summer 2024 offering of Stanford's CS 161 course
(Algorithm Design and Analysis).

Please note that these implementations were written in a rush after each
lecture. They are not intended to be the most efficient, simplest, or otherwise
"best" version of the algorithm. Instead, I focused on sticking as close as
possible to the lecture pseudocode.
